# vite-react-app
A web application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript
First, I created a new GitHub repository. Then, I set up a MySQL database using XAMPP called auth_db and added a table users with id, username, email, password, and phone.

In VS Code, I started a new Node.js project. I downloaded and installed the packages step by step

First express  to create the server and handle routes.

Then mysql2 
Next bcryptjs  to securely hash user passwords.to connect the project to the MySQL database. I set up a db.js file where I used mysql2 and environment variables to connect to the database

After that, jsonwebtoken (JWT)  to create secure login tokens.

Finally dotenv  to manage environment variables for development and production.
